<h2>Anti-Corona Jet Fighter</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
        It's easy to play and fun.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
        Nothing special.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Postmortem:</strong>
        I leaned how to to deal with timer and group collision. <br>
        The hardest part is to modify the object size making sure an object collides with others reasonably. <br>
        One big problem is set up 2 state scene at the end, when everything completed is not a good idea. <br>
        The easiest part is all game physics are handled by Phaser framework and it saved a lot of development time.
