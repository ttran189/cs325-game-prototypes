    <h2>Troll vs Drones</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
            It's easy to play and fun.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
            Nothing special.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
            I leaned how to to set up a project with Phaser. <br>
            The hardest part is the concept of the game. <br>
            The easiest part is all game physics are handled by Phaser framework and it saved a lot of development time.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Troll face: <a href="https://me.me">Me Me</a></li>
                <li>Drone: <a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a></li>

            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
            - Inspired by Flappy Bird. <br>
            - Small part of code was derived from <a href="http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1"> Lessmilk Tutorial</a>
        </li>

        <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            Character is a troll face that tried to avoid the drones flying to toward him. The gravity will bring him down
            and the players have to bring him up by a click, a tap or a space key push.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
            Tropical Forest.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
            For every second, a set of 3 drones are generated with random y values.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            This prototype is good enough for playing. It pointed out some errors and constraints that need to be improved for the final release.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
            I hope people to see it fun and can relax with it.

        </li>

        <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
            No story behind.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            This game targets people from 12 - 60.
